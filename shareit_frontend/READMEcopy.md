### What I learned

This is my first project in which I worked with Sanity. This project helped me in revising some of the core react concepts like react router and hooks like useState and useEffect. Through this project I also learned to write sanity queries 

```react

    export const userQuery = (userId) => {
    const query = `*[_type == "user" && _id == '${userId}']`;

    return query
    };

    export const userCreatedPinsQuery = (userId) => {
    const query = `*[ _type == 'pin' && userId == '${userId}'] | order(_createdAt desc){
        image{
        asset->{
            url
        }
        },
        _id,
        destination,
        postedBy->{
        _id,
        userName,
        image
        },
        save[]{
        postedBy->{
            _id,
            userName,
            image
        },
        },
    }`;
    return query;
    };
```
